Welcome!

This is my portfolio, its main purpose is to:
1. Track progress
2. Have a platform for various tools that I will be working on.
3. Record learning experience.

In this website, you will see:
- Main Page which has a short introduction with buttons that will navigate you through the website.
- Projects page that will have various work that I am currently working on/have worked on.
- Previous Experience page that will have mostly background information.
